# 🎨 **Visual Architecture Prompt for Gemini**

Create a comprehensive system architecture diagram for SkillForge AI with the following specifications:

## **Overall Layout Style:**
- Modern, professional software architecture diagram
- Clean lines, rounded rectangles for components
- Color-coded layers with gradients
- Icons for different technology types
- Flow arrows showing data/request paths
- Hierarchical layout from top (Frontend) to bottom (Database)

## **Layer 1: Frontend UI (Top - Light Blue/Cyan)**
```
Create a browser window representation containing:
- 🌐 HTML5 icon + "Frontend UI"
- 📱 "index.html" with North American flag icons (🇨🇦🇺🇸)
- 🎨 "CSS Grid Layout" + "Responsive Design"
- ⚡ "JavaScript API Calls"
- 📊 "Real-time Career Analysis"
- Show dropdown with cities: "Toronto, Vancouver, New York, San Francisco..."
```

## **Layer 2: API Gateway (Middle-Top - Green)**
```
FastAPI server representation:
- ⚡ FastAPI logo/icon + "API Gateway"
- 4 endpoint boxes connected horizontally:
  - 🔌 "career_intelligence_routes.py"
  - 🔄 "workflow_routes.py" 
  - 🤖 "agent_routes.py"
  - 📊 "analytics_routes.py"
- 🛡️ "CORS Middleware" shield icon
- 🔄 "Background Tasks" with async arrows
```

## **Layer 3: Multi-Agent Intelligence (Middle - Orange/Red)**
```
CrewAI framework visualization:
- 🏢 "CrewAI Framework" central hub
- 3 agent circles connected to hub:
  - 🤖 "Analysis Agent" (Strategic Planning)
  - 🔄 "Workflow Agent" (Process Orchestration)  
  - ⚡ "Execution Agent" (Implementation)
- 🧠 OpenAI GPT connection with brain icon
- Collaboration arrows between agents
```

## **Layer 4: ML Intelligence Engine (Middle-Bottom - Purple)**
```
Machine Learning pipeline:
- 🎯 "Career Intelligence Engine" main box
- 4 ML model components inside:
  - 💰 "Salary Predictor" (93.6% R²)
  - 🎯 "Job Matcher" (74% accuracy)
  - 📈 "Career Classifier" (100% accuracy)
  - 🗺️ "Market Analyzer" (North America)
- 🔬 Scikit-learn + Pandas + NumPy icons
- Data flow arrows showing 3000 samples
```

## **Layer 5: Database Layer (Bottom - Dark Blue)**
```
Data storage representation:
- 3 database cylinders:
  - 🗃️ SQLite (Workflows)
  - 🍃 MongoDB (Analytics)
  - 💾 In-Memory (Cache)
- Data connection lines to ML layer
- 🔄 Persistence arrows
```

## **Geographic Data Overlay (Right Side):**
```
North American map outline with:
- 🇨🇦 Canada section:
  - 6 city dots: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton
  - "CAD $55k base"
- 🇺🇸 USA section:
  - 8 city dots: NYC, SF, Seattle, Austin, Boston, Chicago, LA, Denver
  - "USD $60k base"
- Currency symbols: 💰 CAD vs 💵 USD
```

## **Data Flow Arrows:**
```
Show these key flows with labeled arrows:
1. "User Input" → Frontend → API
2. "Career Analysis" → ML Engine → Market Data
3. "Workflow Creation" → CrewAI Agents → Strategic Planning
4. "Background Execution" → Agent Collaboration → Results
5. "Data Persistence" → Database Layer
```

## **Performance Metrics Box (Bottom Right):**
```
Small metrics panel:
- 📊 "3000 Training Samples"
- 🎯 "93.6% ML Accuracy" 
- ⚡ "<200ms API Response"
- 🌍 "14 North American Cities"
- 🤖 "3 AI Agents"
```

## **Technology Stack Legend (Left Side):**
```
Vertical list with icons:
- 🌐 Frontend: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- ⚡ API: FastAPI + Uvicorn  
- 🤖 Intelligence: CrewAI + OpenAI
- 🔬 ML: Scikit-learn + Pandas
- 🗃️ Database: SQLite + MongoDB
- 🐍 Runtime: Python 3.9+
```

## **Visual Style Guidelines:**
- Use consistent rounded rectangles for all components
- Color gradient: Cool blues (frontend) → Warm colors (processing) → Dark colors (data)
- Include technology logos where possible (Python, FastAPI, etc.)
- Use dotted lines for async/background processes
- Solid arrows for synchronous data flow
- Drop shadows for depth
- Clean, professional typography
- White background with subtle grid pattern

## **Title and Branding:**
```
Top center:
"🚀 SkillForge AI - System Architecture"
"North American Career Intelligence Platform"
"Version 1.0.0 Final | CrewAI Multi-Agent System"
```

This should create a comprehensive, visually appealing architecture diagram that accurately represents the SkillForge AI system with all implemented components, data flows, and geographic coverage.
